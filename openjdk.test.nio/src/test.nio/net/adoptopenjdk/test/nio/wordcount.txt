Touch your toes to your nose
Like a spider on a rose
Lift them way up high
Like a birdie in the sky
Make 'em squiggle, squiggle, squirm
Like a pack of wiggly worms
Touch your toes to your nose.
Touch your toes to your cheek
Touch your toes to your chin
Touch your toes to your knee
Touch your toes to your shin
Touch your toes to your ankle
Touch your toes to your elbow
Touch your toes to someoe's toes
Wiggle and squiggle, open and close
To say Hello-high ho!
Touch you toes to your nose!
